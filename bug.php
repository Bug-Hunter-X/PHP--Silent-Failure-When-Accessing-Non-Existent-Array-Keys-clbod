In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["key1"] = 10;
$myArray[1] = 20;

echo $myArray[0]; // Notice the attempt to access a non-existent key
?>
```

While `$myArray["key1"]` and `$myArray[1]` are assigned values, accessing `$myArray[0]` will not throw an error but instead return NULL. This behavior may not always be immediately apparent, leading to unexpected results.
